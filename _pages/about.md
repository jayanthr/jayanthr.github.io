I am Associate Professor of Healthcare Logistics at KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden. Also associated with Digital Futures, as one of their faculty. 

I build models to improve decision making in complex processes. The models are either simulation-based, data driven or participatory, but more often than not are a combination of the three. I work mainly in healthcare, but have previously worked in urban planning, transportation, energy, agriculture and disaster management.

I teach courses on Applied Machine Learning, at the first, second and third cycle levels (Bachelors, Masters and PhD). I also teach modules on Simulation Thinking, Agent-Based Modeling, AI/ML ethics, Health Informatics and Logistics for various other courses. 

My research interests are in the areas of Complex Systems, Healthcare, Policy Design and in the philosophy of games and simulations.

I completed my Ph D at KTH in 2017. Previously, I worked in the software industry and for a think tank in Bangalore. Scholar and Linkedin are the best places to find my work.
