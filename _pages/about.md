<br>
I'm a computer scientist, passionate about complex, pluralistic and equitable development of technical systems. I currently work in healthcare, at the intersection of models, diagnostics and data. Formally, I am an Associate Professor of Healthcare Logistics at KTH Royal Institute of Technology. 

My current research centers around the use and improvement of data in healthcare, from improving data inter-operability through knowledge graphs and large language models, to early detection of diseased in primary care and uncertain contexts, and developing data-driven methods to understand and improve logistics functions in care delivery. I bring together data science, machine learning, artificial intelligence and semantic technologies to advance biomedical science in the service of improving care. 

I obtained my PhD from KTH Royal Institute of Technology, in 2017, working on distributed, interactive simulations of complex systems, based on the idea that complex systems cannot be managed or understood through reductive methods. My work was applied in developing management mechanisms in large cities, such as Rome, Venice, Haifa and so on. 

I've spent most of my career in Academia, but have previously spent time in industry, as well as non-profit policy research.
