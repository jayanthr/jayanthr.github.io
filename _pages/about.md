I'm a computer scientist, passionate about complex, pluralistic and equitable development of technical systems. I currently work in healthcare, at the intersection of models, diagnostics and data. Formally, I am an Associate Professor of Healthcare Logistics at KTH Royal Institute of Technology. 

My current research centers around the use and improvement of data in healthcare, from improving data inter-operability through knowledge graphs and large language models, to early detection of diseased in primary care and uncertain contexts, and developing data-driven methods to understand and improve logistics functions in care delivery. 

I've spent most of my career in Academia, but have previously spent time in industry, as well as non-profit policy research.
