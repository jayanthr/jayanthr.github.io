##### Digitalization Platform

I was one of the Vice-Directors of the Digitalization Platform at KTH Royal Institute of Technology, an internal organization responsible for co-ordinating research and other activities in Digitalization, between 2019 and 2024. In this role, I managed research calls and funding decisions for a budget of **3 Million SEK**, and helped implement data management infrastructure and processes for the university. This led to the KTH Data Repository, used by research groups across the university. I also helped organize large inter-disciplinary workshops at the intersection of Digitalization and: Life Sciences, Cyber Security, HPC, Energy and Transportation.
