My current research centers around the use and improvement of data in healthcare. It is premised on the fact that there is a need for epistemological pluralism, that there are multiple valid ways of knowing, and is informed by the need for justice and equity in computing. This perspective recognizes the diversity in knowledge discovery, cognitive justice and its connection to equity in computing.

Some themes I am currently working on:

#### Health Data Integration

[Mediverse](https://mediverse-graph.lovable.app/): A schema and standard agnostic multimodal data integration framework based on knowledge graphs, large language models and uncertainty bounded prediction.

#### Real World Evidence

Approaches and models towards RWE from healthcare data. This theme focuses on improvement of cancer outcomes and detection of cancer in highly uncertain contexts.
