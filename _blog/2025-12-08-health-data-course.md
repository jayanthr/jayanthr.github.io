*What makes something data? What makes something a scientific fact? Who/what curates and shapes data, especially in healthcare, and how does that impact patients, their health and the delivery of care?* 

This is a course that I wanted to design and teach for a long time, and finally got the chance to do so as part of the new master's program in Data-driven Health. The course was born out of the desire to do something to educate students on a few incredibly challenging problems: designing the technological infrastructure of the future, assessing the role of institutions, cultures and norms in shaping what we perceive to be data and knowledge, and analyzing how science, technology and politics shape ideas about race and gender. 

A huge part of the motivation for the course is also to elevate the discourse around biases in data and AI. To center the course around the intersection of equity and justice in AI, to acknowledge the inherent lack of neutrality in computing and analayze the root causes, from a historical, decolonial point of view. 

The course sits squarely at the intersection between Science and Technology Studies (STS) and Critical Data Studies (CDS), both highly inter-disciplinary fields which uses theories from anthropology, sociology, philosophy, and history to understand the interconnections between science, technology, and society. 

I have outlined the structure of the course, and listed the material we used in the course. There are undoubtedly more rigorous, detailed courses on similar themes elsewhere, this is meant for engineering students who have never had to engage with these themes or material of this nature. The reading material is also a very small selection of the work done by scholars and activists in articulating the origins, development, and hegemony of the modern tech ecosystem. My hope is that this these will act as inspiration (as it did for our students), and will form a place to situate oneself within and start exploring from. 

If you have comments or suggestions for material, please reach out. If you want to use this in your own course, please send me a note so I know. 

[Mikaela Hellstrand](https://www.kth.se/profile/mihellst?l=en) (one of my PhD students), was an invaluable collaborator in designing and running this course. She helped select a lot of the material, particularly Seminars 1 and 4, and helped sharpen and clarify the goals and outcomes for this course. 

### Syllabus

#### Seminar 1: Primer
A basic primer on terminology and frameworks, to act as a lens to the intersecting fields of ethics, law, epistemology and so on.

#### Seminar 2: Law
[Assoc. Prof. Stanley Greenstein](https://www.su.se/profiles/s/stgr7735) gave a lecture on legislation, and how that operates in this space. 

#### Seminar 3: Health Ethics
[Dr. Barbro Fröding](https://www.kth.se/profile/babbi) gave a lecture on ethics, focusing on principalism, and ethical principles. 

#### Seminar 4: Data-Knowledge-Power
This seminar digs deeper into the interplay between the concepts of data,  knowledge and power. Departing from a perspective which views data as a sociotechnical phenomenon, we explore how data connects to power and politics, how data-driven ways of working affects everyday health care contexts, what happens when the logic of care meet the logic of data
and the role of the body in knowledge production and how this relates to data
