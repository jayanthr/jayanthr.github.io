The dashboard branch contains a visualization dashboad developed for the PETRA EU FP7 project. The dashboard contains an user interface to various forms of data visualisation, as well as a number of tools, fixes, and optimizations. Additionally, various scenes have been created using these new features. The dashboard was developed based on ProtoWorld, by TUDelft.
